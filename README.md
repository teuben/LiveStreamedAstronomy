# LiveStreamedAstronomy

### processing the LiveStreamedAstronomy for RSS

This currently converts the tsv file that has to be manually downloaded into an rss xml file.
Created in March 2020 because of the large interest from the community to make talks available.
The current version copies the file to my private web page, but it should not take much to
use more automated and in a more industrial setting.

The current hack can be used via http://www.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/aas/rss4.xml  I personally use feedly.com,but I've also tested this in thunderbird.
